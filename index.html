        China has been thriving in the economy in the past few years.<br />
        But ever since the carbon emissions in China have increased,<br />
        many trees have been dying. Almost 4.5 billion trees have died<br />
        in China, and the tree population is still decreasing rapidly. A
        researcher<br />
        at The University of China has reported, "After exploring China, we
        have<br />
        realized that only 800 trees are remaining in the country." (Randy
        Jones). <br />People will have to leave China because there won't be
        enough trees, <br />said a reporter from CNN. Many residents of China
        have had to migrate to<br />
        another country forcefully by the government but were given
        compensation<br />
        to upwards of 50 thousand U.S. dollars. A former Chinese citizen<br />
        was interviewed and stated that he was, "Angry when I was given a
        notice<br />
        by government officials saying that he had to move to a different
        place."
